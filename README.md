# Instructions
You can simmulate traffic buy modifying the time of each traffic light on either the right or left lane , as well as modifying the rate of vehicles in each lane.

You can add these as command line arguments by specifying the rate of left and right traffic as floating points and the time interval of traffic for right and left  
traffic as integers. (passed through as command line arguments in that specific order respectivly).

A compilation script is already written , and also runs once compiled , if downloaded you can either use WSL on windows or if on native linux you can type "chmod u+x compile" to allow for the script to be an executable

you can then run the program as follows:

./compile runSimulations leftTraffic RightTraffic leftTime rightTime
